# CTIS 310 Mini Project 4

This is the CTIS 310 Mini Project 4 assignment for Keval Shah and Austin Varghese. This program demonstrates four common sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, and quick sort. There are 10 text fields where numbers from 0-99 can be typed in or automatically filled in randomly with the "Randomly Generate Numbers" button. The individual steps of the algorithm are displayed below the text fields when the start button is pressed.

# Installation
Download the .zip file and import it into the NetBeans (https://netbeans.apache.org/) editor.

# Usage
Click the "Play" button at the top of the NetBeans editor or use the shortcut Shift-F6 to run the program. Navigate to the different tabs and enter numbers into the text fields or use the button to randomly generate numbers. Once all of the text fields are filled out, click the start button to start the algorithm and see the result and steps used below the text fields and buttons.
